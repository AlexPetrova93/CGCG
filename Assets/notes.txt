CustomRenderPass:
*When multiple postprocessing effects are added on the camera, they are executed in the order they are shown in the 
inspector* (topmost effect being rendered first. Result of one effect is passed as “source image” to the next one; 
and internally Unity creates one or more temporary render textures to keep these intermediate results in.)
